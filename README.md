Adding Images to Your README

To enhance the visual appeal of your README, you can include images such as screenshots or diagrams. Here's how to add images:

Upload Images to Your Repository:

Create a folder in your repository (e.g., assets/images/) to store your images.
Upload the desired images to this folder.
Reference Images in the README:

Use the following Markdown syntax to add images:

markdown
Copy
Edit
![Alt Text](relative/path/to/image.png)
Alt Text: A brief description of the image.
relative/path/to/image.png: The path to the image file in your repository.
For example:

markdown
Copy
Edit
![Homepage Screenshot](assets/images/homepage.png)
This will display the image in your README where the Markdown is placed.

For more detailed guidance on adding images to your README, you can refer to this article: How to Add Images to README.md on GitHub?
